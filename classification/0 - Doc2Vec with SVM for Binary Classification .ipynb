Basically, we're pretending as if the training corpus is some new unseen data and then seeing how they compare with the trained model. The expectation is that we've likely overfit our model (i.e., all of the ranks will be less than 2) and so we should be able to find similar documents very easily. Additionally, we'll keep track of the second ranks for a comparison of less similar documents."
